        A perfect introduction. 
        
        A Game of Thrones is the first novel in the unfinished A Song of Ice and Fire series. It is also the tightest and most concise entry. This may seem an odd thing to say about a book spanning over 800 pages, but AGOT does a fantastic job of slowly feeding information to the reader about the world without overwhelming them, as well as giving (almost) every viewpoint character a satisfying and exciting storyline. This book is the most Stark-centric in the series with all but two of the viewpoint characters being members of the family. This is a wonderful starting point as we get emotionally attached to the Starks and their respective goals, hopes, and dreams, before the story takes a turn and the surviving family members are scattered across Westeros. 
        
        This is my second time reading the series and I have a notably better appreciation for certain things the second time around and recommend a re-read to anyone who may have enjoyed this story years ago. I found myself enjoying different character’s chapters more than I did the first time around. On my first reading I remember looking forward to Danaerys’ chapters, and although I would still consider them good, I found myself less interested in her story knowing that by the end of book five she is still in Essos with her dragons with no immediate plans to invade Westeros. On the other hand I enjoyed Bran’s chapters more the second time around. On my first readthrough I felt his sections were boring, slow, and uneventful on the whole. This time, though, I was thoroughly invested in Bran’s journey, as he slowly realizes that he is not destined to be a knight as he always dreamed, but to explore the dark and mysterious magic of the old gods of the north. Sansa’s POV, unfortunately, was as dull and annoying as I remembered, and there were a few moments reading this book that I turned the page to see a Sansa chapter and decided I was done reading for the day.
        
        Overall, while I think this is a great, epic fantasy novel and the perfect introduction to the world of Westeros, I am looking forward much more to the later books that I remember less vividly and which go beyond the war of the five kings and set in motion the downfall of the Lannisters, set up Dorne’s role in future politics, and introduce interesting characters like Young Griff and Euron. Thoroughly enjoyed it and excited for more!

        Not quite as good, but still good.
	
        A Clash of Kings has a difficult job. The book is tasked with both following up the incredible debut of A Game of Thrones with a worthy sequel, but also setting up countless plot points and schemes for its own sequel. It’s incredibly ambitious, and what’s more amazing is that it actually does pull this off. The book is only slightly less exciting than the books that immediately precede and follow it, but full of great moments. Tyrion’s defense of King’s Landing was particularly thrilling and seems to have gotten more violent and chaotic since I read it last. The aftermath of Robert Baratheon’s death in book one is very fun to watch unfold as both of his brothers proclaim themselves kings and fail miserably. Dany continues to build her strength in Essos, Jon adventures past the wall, and Arya is on the run from the Lannisters. It’s all very exciting. Catelyn on the other hand spends the book worrying about her children for the most part. Realistic, yes, but it does start to get a bit tiresome after a while. Sansa spends this book locked up in King’s Landing. You may have noticed I’m not a Sansa fan, so let me explain. Her main purpose thematically in these first three books is to teach the reader the lesson that there are no knights in shining armor in Westeros coming to save a maiden in distress, and her real protectors are all repulsive to her or have unknown motivations. This is all well and good, these themes are central to A Song of Ice and Fire and are present in many characters’ stories in the series. Her practical purpose in these books seems to be to give the readers eyes and ears in King’s Landing to see the political drama unfolding. However, in book one Ned and Arya are both in Kings Landing too, and book two Tyrion is there so she’s a bit redundant in that regard. That is my main issue with Sansa. Besides her passive role in her own chapters and having nothing happen to her of her own accord, she is largely redundant from a storytelling perspective. That being said, I think she will play an important role in later books so I will hold off on her for now.
	
        Besides returning characters, A Clash of Kings begins the series tradition of introducing new viewpoint characters in each book. Theon and Davos are this book's additions and both come with a good amount of exposition and worldbuilding. Theon brings with him the lore of the Iron Isles, which isn’t my favorite culture to read about - a bit too obsessed with salt and iron for my taste - but does introduce us to his sister, Asha, and his uncles Euron, Victarion, and Aeron, although they don’t get a proper intro until book four. Davos on the other hand introduces Stannis and his strange relationship with and reliance on Melisandre, a mysterious witch/priestess from distant lands. Stannis’ journey is fascinating even if he himself is pretty unlikeable. I can never decide whether I’m rooting for Stannis or I want him to just give up and go home. You’re not going to be king, Stannis, I’m sorry. It’s just not going to happen.
	
        This book is great. It expands the world of the first book and manages to fit almost an entire war while managing to give each viewpoint character their own struggles and challenges to overcome, AND it sets up a bunch of stuff that the third book then slam dunks in one of the most exciting climatic endings that had me sprinting through the last hundred-or-so pages even on my second read through. But that’s the next book. A Clash of Kings is fantastic. Not my favorite in the series, but a solid read with some really great dramatic moments throughout.
