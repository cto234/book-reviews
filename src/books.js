        A perfect introduction. 
        
        A Game of Thrones is the first novel in the unfinished A Song of Ice and Fire series. It is also the tightest and most concise entry. This may seem an odd thing to say about a book spanning over 800 pages, but AGOT does a fantastic job of slowly feeding information to the reader about the world without overwhelming them, as well as giving (almost) every viewpoint character a satisfying and exciting storyline. This book is the most Stark-centric in the series with all but two of the viewpoint characters being members of the family. This is a wonderful starting point as we get emotionally attached to the Starks and their respective goals, hopes, and dreams, before the story takes a turn and the surviving family members are scattered across Westeros. 
        
        This is my second time reading the series and I have a notably better appreciation for certain things the second time around and recommend a re-read to anyone who may have enjoyed this story years ago. I found myself enjoying different character’s chapters more than I did the first time around. On my first reading I remember looking forward to Danaerys’ chapters, and although I would still consider them good, I found myself less interested in her story knowing that by the end of book five she is still in Essos with her dragons with no immediate plans to invade Westeros. On the other hand I enjoyed Bran’s chapters more the second time around. On my first readthrough I felt his sections were boring, slow, and uneventful on the whole. This time, though, I was thoroughly invested in Bran’s journey, as he slowly realizes that he is not destined to be a knight as he always dreamed, but to explore the dark and mysterious magic of the old gods of the north. Sansa’s POV, unfortunately, was as dull and annoying as I remembered, and there were a few moments reading this book that I turned the page to see a Sansa chapter and decided I was done reading for the day.
        
        Overall, while I think this is a great, epic fantasy novel and the perfect introduction to the world of Westeros, I am looking forward much more to the later books that I remember less vividly and which go beyond the war of the five kings and set in motion the downfall of the Lannisters, set up Dorne’s role in future politics, and introduce interesting characters like Young Griff and Euron. Thoroughly enjoyed it and excited for more!

        Not quite as good, but still good.
	
        A Clash of Kings has a difficult job. The book is tasked with both following up the incredible debut of A Game of Thrones with a worthy sequel, but also setting up countless plot points and schemes for its own sequel. It’s incredibly ambitious, and what’s more amazing is that it actually does pull this off. The book is only slightly less exciting than the books that immediately precede and follow it, but full of great moments. Tyrion’s defense of King’s Landing was particularly thrilling and seems to have gotten more violent and chaotic since I read it last. The aftermath of Robert Baratheon’s death in book one is very fun to watch unfold as both of his brothers proclaim themselves kings and fail miserably. Dany continues to build her strength in Essos, Jon adventures past the wall, and Arya is on the run from the Lannisters. It’s all very exciting. Catelyn on the other hand spends the book worrying about her children for the most part. Realistic, yes, but it does start to get a bit tiresome after a while. Sansa spends this book locked up in King’s Landing. You may have noticed I’m not a Sansa fan, so let me explain. Her main purpose thematically in these first three books is to teach the reader the lesson that there are no knights in shining armor in Westeros coming to save a maiden in distress, and her real protectors are all repulsive to her or have unknown motivations. This is all well and good, these themes are central to A Song of Ice and Fire and are present in many characters’ stories in the series. Her practical purpose in these books seems to be to give the readers eyes and ears in King’s Landing to see the political drama unfolding. However, in book one Ned and Arya are both in Kings Landing too, and book two Tyrion is there so she’s a bit redundant in that regard. That is my main issue with Sansa. Besides her passive role in her own chapters and having nothing happen to her of her own accord, she is largely redundant from a storytelling perspective. That being said, I think she will play an important role in later books so I will hold off on her for now.
	
        Besides returning characters, A Clash of Kings begins the series tradition of introducing new viewpoint characters in each book. Theon and Davos are this book's additions and both come with a good amount of exposition and worldbuilding. Theon brings with him the lore of the Iron Isles, which isn’t my favorite culture to read about - a bit too obsessed with salt and iron for my taste - but does introduce us to his sister, Asha, and his uncles Euron, Victarion, and Aeron, although they don’t get a proper intro until book four. Davos on the other hand introduces Stannis and his strange relationship with and reliance on Melisandre, a mysterious witch/priestess from distant lands. Stannis’ journey is fascinating even if he himself is pretty unlikeable. I can never decide whether I’m rooting for Stannis or I want him to just give up and go home. You’re not going to be king, Stannis, I’m sorry. It’s just not going to happen.
	
        This book is great. It expands the world of the first book and manages to fit almost an entire war while managing to give each viewpoint character their own struggles and challenges to overcome, AND it sets up a bunch of stuff that the third book then deftly weaves together to make one of the most exciting climatic, back-to-back cliffhanger endings ever. But I’m getting ahead of myself. A Clash of Kings is fantastic. Not my favorite in the series, but a solid read with some really great dramatic moments throughout.

        review: `
        Clocking in at over 1100 pages, A Storm of Swords is a shining example of sprawling, epic fantasy at its best. Spoilers ahead.
	    
        This book is a turning point in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, marking the end of the first half of the series and introducing completely new plotlines for nearly all of the main viewpoint characters we have been experiencing the story through thus far. I have to start with the ending. ASOS ends in a series of thrilling cliffhangers that serve to radically change the trajectory of not only the main characters, but Westeros and Essos as a whole. Tyrion, who has spent the series wrapped up in Lannister politics and vying for his father’s approval, ends the book by being falsely accused of murdering the king, thrown in the dungeons, escaping, and murdering his lover and father before escaping across the Narrow Sea towards an uncertain future. Jon finishes the book reunited with the Night’s Watch and being chosen to lead them against what he now knows is a seemingly insurmountable foe: the Others. Sansa finally escapes King’s Landing only to find that Littlefinger was orchestrating her rescue for unknown reasons. He then murders her aunt in front of her. Dany, who has spent the entire story thus far wandering from place to place in Essos, settles down to rule Mereen and truly learn to be a Queen. Arya leaves Westeros entirely and begins her training as a strange magical assassin.
	    
        While the ending is my favorite section of the book, there are still plenty of moments throughout to keep the reader invested. In fact, the whole story flies by at breakneck speed, making the 1100 pages seem much shorter. The Red Wedding is often cited as one of the defining moments in the series and for good reason. Robb’s odds are not good for winning the north from the Lannisters, but his death at the hands of the Freys comes seemingly out of nowhere. Martin does a fantastic job of setting a foreboding tone just before it happens by alternating between Arya and Catelyn’s viewpoints, creating a sense of urgency and uncertainty. Also present is the Purple Wedding, or Joffrey’s death, the fake out of Prince Oberyn’s battle with Ser Gregor, the reveal of Beric Dondarrion’s repeated deaths and revivals, and, my personal favorite, Jaime’s redemption. Jaime’s addition as a viewpoint character seems an odd choice at first. He was, after all, one of the most unapologetically evil, unpleasant, and easily hateable characters in the first two books. Gaining access to his inner thoughts, however, reveals him to be a complex character, full of doubts and fears that only grow stronger after his sword hand is cut off. His and Brienne’s story is ultimately one of the best in this book, with each character containing elements that the other most wishes they could have. Brienne wishes she had been born a man, and handsome, so nobody would question her devotion to knighthood, and Jaime finds himself in awe of Brienne’s unwavering commitment to doing the right, honorable thing at every turn. Together they form the perfect knight. The thing they both want more than anything.
	    
        Before this review gets to be as long as the book itself I’ll just say this. A Storm of Swords is a near-perfect conclusion to the first Act of the series. I hugely enjoyed reading it and I look forward to seeing what comes next. Again.

        The worst one. But still pretty good.
        
        I have pretty negative memories of this book. All I remember from the first time I reached book 4 of A Song of Ice and Fire was… well, not much. I remember Brienne, mostly, or rather I remember hating reading her chapters, which, in my memory, seemed to take up half the book and consist of wandering through cold, wet forest searching in vain for a character who we know for a fact to be hundreds of miles away.

        On my second read through, though, I had a bit of a change of heart. Not only are Brienne’s chapters not as bad as all that (although I still wouldn’t consider them particularly great), but they don’t take up nearly as much of the book as I remember. Instead what I found were some pleasantly slow-paced chapters that allow the audience to look around the world of Westeros, and spend some time getting to know the common folk as they’re known. That being said, Brienne’s mission to find Sansa and Arya is completely pointless as we know where both of these characters are and we know that Brienne isn’t even close. Her arc in this book falls prey to something that occurs to many of the characters in both Feast and its sequel, which is that their stories only get really exciting at the very end, at which point they stop and are looking increasingly unlikely to ever be picked back up again as the Winds of Winter continues to not exist.
        
        What’s truly noteworthy about this book is actually what it doesn’t contain. That being Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Daenerys Targaryen. You know, the MAIN CHARACTERS OF THE SERIES. Yes it’s popular to complain about this, but really, what an insane decision by Martin. But let’s not get too far into that and instead discuss what this book does have. Cersei! Her debut as a POV character is really fantastic. We get to watch as she, without fail, ruins every chance she will ever have at truly being queen and being taken seriously, which is all she really wants. Instead she continually insults and undercuts the Tyrell’s, her one powerful ally, alienates the one family member she has left that might actually want to help her, and successfully turns both the nobles and common folk against herself, all while creating her new worst enemy: an armed force of holy warriors. Her downfall is truly satisfying, and it’s a fun twist to see it all from her point of view.
        
        Other new additions are not so successful. Dorne is completely boring. I know some people find it interesting, and I agree that it could be: the odd one out of the seven kingdoms, untouched by the war and mysteriously absent from the last few books until Oberyn Martell appeared and was quickly murdered in Storm. But it’s all just so boring. We get a single chapter from the POV of the kingsguard sent to protect Myrcella, one chapter from Areo Hotah, who has the personality of a plank of wood, a couple from Arianne who hatches a terrible plan, immediately fails, and then spends a whole chapter in solitary confinement. Wow, fun. That’s not to say that what’s going on in Dorne isn’t interesting. The plot to crown Myrcella is kind of a cool idea, but the way the Dorne chapters are all written is just confusing. They introduce too many characters who are then never seen again and have little to no defining characteristics.
        
        Moving on to the Iron Islands. I liked these slightly more the second time around just because I know that Euron and Victarion do end up going on to do interesting stuff, but it’s similar to Dorne where there’s some mildly interesting ideas but I’m left thinking “Ok but what’s Jon Snow doing? Who cares about these viking guys?” Asha’s chapters were alright, though, I liked the one where she gets captured by Stannis. But that’s just because Stannis is much more interesting than the ironborn.

        Like I mentioned earlier, though, the fun is all saved for the end of the book. Littlefinger reveals his plan to Sansa, Cersei gets arrested, Brienne meets Lady Stoneheart, and Victarion heads towards Dany. A few of these plot threads actually get picked up in the next book only to end in another cliffhanger. Overall this book is frustrating, but the second read through did allow me to slow down and appreciate what was happening, rather than what I was missing, so I did enjoy it for that. There was a lot I had forgotten about.        `

        Highs and lows
        
        Finally Jon, Dany, and Tyrion are back. They’re presence sorely missed from the last book, it’s great to finally catch back up with them and find out what’s been happening at the Wall, in Mereen, and wherever Tyrion wound up. None of these characters disappoint. Jon’s struggles at the wall culminating in his tragic murder (no I don’t care about spoilers in these reviews) is extremely well done, if a bit repetitive. Tyrion’s chapters in this book get quite a bit of hate online. I will say I didn’t remember some of his more brutal scenes (especially the one at a brothel about midway through the book), and he certainly is less likable than he has ever been, but he’s still Tyrion and it’s not hard to sympathize with him, being shipped around the world against his will immediately after killing his own father and finding out that his first wife had actually loved him. His chapters also include one of my favorite aspects of this book : Aegon! I’m pretty certain he is actually a Blackfyre given how much backstory is given to their history in this book and, most importantly, the fact that Aegon is backed by the Golden Company: the mercenary group created with the sole purpose of putting a Blackfyre on the throne. The same Blackfyres who's worst enemy was the Targaryens. So yeah I don’t think he’s really Rhaegar’s son. Dany’s story is… ok. It’s not terrible, and it is nice to see her just being Queen, since I personally don’t think she will ever truly rule in Westeros. But being queen isn’t easy. It’s a lot like Jon’s storyline: the struggling leader against overwhelming odds.

        The side characters really shine in this one. Theon really steals the show here as Reek. His sudden appearance after multiple books of apparently being dead is horrifying. The character known as Reek has had every trace of Theon taken from him by the evil Ramsay Snow, and we get to watch as Theon slowly remembers who he is, though he’s still a little crazy by the end. Maybe more than a little. Arya’s chapters are pretty fun in this one, although her best was released afterwards as a sample chapter for Winds of Winter. Bran’s story has become quite horrifying as he spends almost all his time in a dark cave with an ancient undead wizard learning mysterious powers, seeing into the past and across the world. I only wish we got to see more of him. Jon Connington is a great new character, and I can’t wait to see how his story plays out (if it ever does). Lastly, Ser Barristan has some great chapters. I love the one where he stages a coup, confronts Hizdahr and easily defeats the King’s bodyguard with his plate armor and years of experience. 

        They’re not all winners. Quentyn’s chapters are completely pointless, for one. We already have more than enough chapters dedicated to Tyrion traveling from Westeros to Meereen. Do we really need more, but with completely unknown characters? Even on my first read through I never for one second thought that Daenerys would marry him nor that his plan to steal Dany’s dragons would work. If that was meant to be a twist ending it failed miserably. His chapters are completely unnecessary, and I would have opted to remove his character entirely. Speaking of Dany, while I find her overall story to be fairly interesting, her constant drooling over Daario gets pretty old, and her refusal to leave Meereen is downright frustrating. As readers we all know that Dany is, at some point, going to leave Meereen and invade Westeros. There is no other way for her story to go, and yet in this book she repeatedly doubles down and says she’s staying and she can’t leave her children, and so on. So Dany continues to be the character that I like much less on second reading. 

        This is really the overall problem with this book. We, as readers, know certain things are going to happen in this story. We know Dany needs to come to Westeros. We know Tyrion needs to get to Dany and join her (or at least it seems very very likely that this happens), we know Sansa is going to do…something. Eventually. We know Jon Snow is going to need to win lords to his cause of defeating the Others. We know the Others need to invade and will likely destroy at least a large portion of the Wall. We know these things and yet… the whole plot has moved a total of two inches. And not from the last book, which takes place mostly at the same time as this one, but from a Storm of Swords. In a Game of Thrones Tyrion goes from King’s Landing to Winterfell to the Wall to the Riverlands to the Eyrie, back to the Riverlands, fights in his first real battle, and is then sent back to King’s Landing. A Dance with Dragons is longer than A Game of Thrones and in this book Tyrion leaves King’s Landing for Meereen (by way of Pentos) and by the end of the book he’s STILL NOT THERE. He’s outside the city walls. I know technically that’s a huge distance in-universe but plot wise this is insane. Every character’s arc feels this way in this book, except Theon and maybe Jon. They’ve gone nowhere. Nothing that important has really happened. Everyone is more or less where they were when the book started. So while I do like some of the things this book introduces, it’s impossible to look back on it and not feel a little cheated. That being said, it’s still better to do nothing with characters you like than to do nothing with characters you don’t, so this book is still better than a Feast for Crows.

        I don't have much to say about this book, really. It was good... until it wasn't. I enjoyed some parts, particularly the section where Kerouac recounts his climb of a mountain with his mountain man friend, and the descriptions of some wild bohemian parties, but ultimately I got a bit bored with the character constantly talking about Buddhism and being enlightened, if only because it happens to abruptly. He seems to discover Buddhism and immediately declare himself an expert and go on about it for ages to random people. Probably not a fun guy to hang out with. I do prefer On the road for its relativre lack of preachiness and listen-to-me-I-know-everything-ness (although there is still a fair amount of that), and its faster pace. Overall, it was alright, but it certainly made me want to go out and be in nature!.`

        review: `How is this book not famous?
        
        The story of Trask by Don Berry (coincidentally the author was friends with Gary Snyder AKA Japhy Ryder - the main character of the Dharma Bums) is a simple one. A rough mountain man named Elbridge Trask has been living in the Oregon territory for years with his wife Hannah, alongside the friendly Clatsop tribe. One day he infds himself drawn to travel southward into Killamook territory, a less friendly tribe and uncertain land. He does so with the help of two Clatsops, and in the process learns much about himself. 
        
        I was worried I might get bored with this one. It starts off pretty slow, but the writing is so beautifully done, and the wilderness is so clearly evoked that I found myself enjoying Trask's slow meditations on whether or not he should consider traveling south. I found myself attatched to the characters. Trask with his stoic attitude and inner conflict, Wakila with his innocence and determination to make Trask and his tribe proud, and Charley Kewha, the mysterious and wise Clatsop who slowly wins over both the reader and Trask. 
        
        (Spoilers!) The final quarter of this book is a masterpiece. Trask's hopeless, solitary journey into the storm is full of foreboding, and turns out so much worse than I could have imagined. The whole section of Trask carrying Charley's body back to the tribe is harrowing, and made all the worse with Trask clearly being in shock, compounded with his lack of food or water for days, giving us a really tragic scene where Charley Kewha's dead body is urging Trask onward, thereby fulfilling Trask's near-impossible goal of completing the 'Searching' ritual.
        
        This book is fantastic, and especially good for me as an Oregonian. I loved it beginning to end, and was suprised by just how engaged I was in the story and characters. I would recommend this book to anyone.`
