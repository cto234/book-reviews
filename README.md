# Connor's Book Reviews

This is a little app for me to rate and publish reviews for the books I've been reading lately. Built from scratch using React. I had the idea recently as I've been rereading the Game of Thrones books and wanted to be able to rate each one and write a quick review. I decided to make this site to allow me to do that but also to add any other books I may have read recently or will read in the future. It's very simple, the books are stored as objects in an array in books.js along with their respective cover image, rating, and review. They are displayed on the home page in a grid, and on click it goes to a page that displays each book's information. I just used plain CSS for this one, no SASS or Chakra UI. I built this all in one day, not including the reviews and some minor styling fixes, and my goal was to make it fairly minimal and simple. I think in this regard it is perfect. This was a fun little project and got me more familiar with React, specifically file structure and how components are written in isolation and the combined.
